# Windows 10

When running the Windows 10 Local policy script, direct yourself to the **Windows 10/All Policy Scripts**. Download **the entire** folder. Run the **run.bat** file as an administrator, and all the local policies should be changed.

# Debian

Download Debian folder and run each script with these commands:
1. ```chmod +x [filename]``` ex: ```chmod +x Asofwarem.sh```
2. ```sudo ./[filename]```

Make sure to open Terminal in the Debian folder, or move into the Debian folder using ```cd```.<br />
Add ```#!/usr/bin/env bash``` to top of ```.sh``` file if it doesn't run.
